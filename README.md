# Supervised machine learning to predict used vehicles prices

For this Capnstone project I'm using Used Cars Dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data. Dataset contains ~500K records about used cars and their prices collected from craigslist The goal of this project is build a model using supervised machine learning algorithms to predict prices of used vehicles.


* Notebook contains all code of this project 

* Presentation  contains code formatted for presentation in RISE  (https://rise.readthedocs.io/)
